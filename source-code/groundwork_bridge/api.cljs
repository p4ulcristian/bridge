  "Named messages come in, a handler's steps answer them, the answers go
   out: how a browser and a server talk, the browser's side. Named messages
   over http, sse and ws. The server's side is this namespace's .clj half;
   an answer is told from a refusal by groundwork-steps's is-error-answer?.

   The addresses and the sse and ws reopen delays come from the server
   (the app puts them in the page); the browser uses the same shapes as
   the server's handlers, by name, each written out (nil: as it is; {}:
   no reasons), from a .cljc file of the app's:

     (def shapes-by-name {:orders/of-shop {:params-shape [:map [:shop/id :uuid]]
                                           :answer-shape [:vector [:map [:order/id :uuid] [:order/total :decimal]]]
                                           :refusals     {:shop/closed [:map [:shop/opens-at :time/instant]]}}
                          :sync/changed   {:params-shape nil :answer-shape nil :refusals {}}})
