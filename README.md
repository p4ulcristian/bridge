# bridge

Named messages come in, a handler's steps answer them, the answers go out:
how a browser and a Clojure server talk. A message is a map of names to
data, `{:orders/of-shop {:shop/id 7}}`; the server answers it from one
handler table, by name, over three pipes: **http** (a POST, answered at
once), **sse** (the server stream, to the browser) and **ws** (a websocket,
both ways). A handler's work is its **steps**, a list over one map, the
context, run until one adds an answer (the steps, their context's keys and
the refusal's shape are [groundwork-steps](https://github.com/p4ulcristian/groundwork-steps)'s).
Each handler may say its shapes, so ids, decimals and dates arrive as real
types and an answer leaves only as its shape allows; a rate limit per
asker; and every page answered by the server when it is opened fresh. The
browser's following of the address bar is groundwork-screens's.

```clojure
io.github.p4ulcristian/groundwork-bridge {:git/tag "v0.7.10" :git/sha "a8acef8"}
```

Needs Jetty 12 through [rj9a](https://github.com/sunng87/ring-jetty9-adapter)
(no servlet layer; [why](decisions/2026-10-23-the-server-is-jetty-12-through-rj9a.md)),
reitit-ring (the server's routes), [groundwork-steps](https://github.com/p4ulcristian/groundwork-steps) (a handler's steps and the answer's shape, both sides) and [groundwork-shaped-json](https://github.com/p4ulcristian/groundwork-shaped-json) (data keeps its
types across the edge), and on the server
[groundwork-logs](https://github.com/p4ulcristian/groundwork-logs) (the app's log, handed
down) and [groundwork-metrics](https://github.com/p4ulcristian/groundwork-metrics) (the app's
metrics, handed in). One public namespace, `groundwork-bridge.api`: a `.clj` for the server, a
`.cljs` for the browser.

The app makes its shaper once, on each side, and hands it in: every function
that sends or reads a message takes it under `:shaper` in its options
(`make-routes-for-messages`, `answer-message`; in the browser
`send-message!`, `open-sse-line!`, `open-ws-line!`), and a line keeps the
one it was opened with. bridge never makes a shaper.

So with the log, on the server: `make-routes-for-messages` and
`answer-message` take the app's `(log level event data)` under `:log`,
`start-server!` in a new options map, `{:log log}`. Each message gets a log
with a new random `{:request-id "…"}` as its context; every step's context
holds it at `:groundwork-steps/log`, and the app's shaper at `:groundwork-steps/shaper`, beside
the request, the message's name and its data (`:groundwork-steps/request`,
`:groundwork-steps/message-name`, `:groundwork-steps/message-data`). A step
that learns more (who is asking) puts a log with more context back at
`:groundwork-steps/log` for the steps after it. A handler that throws is written
there, `:groundwork-bridge/handler-failed`; a failure no step caught goes to
`start-server!`'s log, `:groundwork-bridge/server-error`
([why](decisions/2026-10-22-the-app-passes-its-log.md)). Jetty's own lines go
to SLF4J, to whatever the app puts behind it.

A step answers with data, or refuses with a named reason its handler
declares, with data by the reason's shape
([why](decisions/2026-10-23-a-refusal-is-a-named-reason-declared-on-its-handler.md)):

```clojure
{:orders/ship {… :refusals {:order/already-shipped [:map [:order/shipped-at :time/instant]]
                            :order/no-address      nil}}}            ; nil: no data; {} for no reasons

(steps/refuse context :order/already-shipped {:order/shipped-at shipped-at})
;; on the groundwork-shaped-json, over http, sse and ws alike, with the message's request id:
{:orders/ship {:groundwork-steps/refused :order/already-shipped :groundwork-steps/data {:order/shipped-at "…"}
               :groundwork-steps/request-id "5f0c…"}}
```

The reason is the key of its text in the app's catalogs and its data the
text's arguments; no English travels. The reasons every answer may carry
besides its handler's own are groundwork-steps's `refusals`, which bridge
gives: `:groundwork-steps/too-many {:retry-after-ms n}` (over the
`:rate-limit`), `:groundwork-steps/invalid {:errors …}` (params that don't fit),
`:groundwork-steps/failed` (a bug: a step threw, no step answered, an answer or a
refusal's data didn't fit its shape, a reason the handler doesn't
declare, a name no handler has), and in the browser `:groundwork-steps/no-answer
{:http-status n}` and `:groundwork-steps/unfit {:errors …}`. Every refusal is
written to the message's log, `:info :groundwork-bridge/refused`; every bug with its
details, `:error` (a name no handler has, `:warn`); either is found by the
refusal's request id. A POST carrying several names stays 200.

And with the meter: `make-routes-for-messages` takes the app's meter under
`:meter` and declares bridge's metrics on it
([why](decisions/2026-10-23-messages-and-lines-are-counted-on-the-apps-meter.md)):
`groundwork_bridge_messages_total{name,pipe,outcome}`, each named message answered
on http or ws (`ok`, `invalid`, `refused`, `too-many`, `failed`, `unfit`,
`no-handler`); `groundwork_bridge_answer_seconds{name}`, its time, in the settings'
`:metric-buckets`; `groundwork_bridge_open_lines{pipe}`, the open sse and ws lines.
The names are the handler table's: one no handler has is counted as
`"other"`. `answer-message` takes the meter too, with the settings'
`:metric-buckets`, and counts each message it answers exactly as the same
message sent to the http address, pipe `http`: a token's call answered on
the app's own route, the REPL's, a test's on a meter of its own
([why](decisions/2026-10-23-every-answered-message-is-counted-on-the-meter-whichever-door.md)).

## The api

| side | name | does |
|---|---|---|
| server | `settings-shape` | the settings as a malli shape, every key required |
| server | `make-routes-for-messages` | the three routes, at the settings' addresses, from the handler table, by the options' `:shaper`, `:log` and `:meter`; a handler's `:rate-limit` counted per asker |
| server | `make-server-routes-for-pages` `make-ring-handler-from-routes` | each page answered when opened fresh; the one Ring handler, files from `:files` (nil for none), what no route answers from `:not-found` (nil: 404; [why](decisions/2026-10-23-not-found-is-the-apps.md)) |
| server | `start-server!` `stop-server!` | Jetty 12, every request on a virtual thread; `{:log log}`; a stop closes the sse lines, lets running requests finish, then cuts |
| server | `send-message-on-sse-line!` `send-message-on-ws-line!` `is-line-open?` `close-line!` | the server sends on an open line by itself, by the shaper the line keeps, or closes it; a line the browser left is closed when its socket ends |
| server | `answer-message` | a message's answer without a server: tests, the REPL (`:no-rate-limits`, written out; the request nil for a message that came with none), or a message answered off the server's addresses (a limiter from `make-message-limiter`); `{:wire groundwork-shaped-json :log log :meter meter :metric-buckets (:metric-buckets settings)}`, counted on the meter as over http |
| server | `make-message-limiter` | a limiter for `answer-message`: each handler's `:rate-limit` counted per asker, by the caller's `:find-rate-limit-key`, in buckets of its own, not the server's ([why](decisions/2026-10-23-a-message-answered-off-the-servers-addresses-is-limited-by-the-callers-limiter.md)) |
| server | `find-client-address` | the asker's address, behind a proxy too |
| server | `make-rate-limited-ring-handler` | a plain route (not a message) behind its own limiter, the same buckets, `429` over it ([why](decisions/2026-10-23-a-plain-route-is-rate-limited-by-the-same-buckets.md)) |
| browser | `send-message!` | http: a promise of the answer, shaped, by the options' `:shaper`, with the options' `:headers` beside bridge's own (`{}` for none), and `:keep-alive?`, true for a request that finishes after the page closes (fetch's keepalive); it never fails for want of an answer: no response, or one that isn't the server's JSON, is `:groundwork-steps/no-answer {:http-status n}` under each name |
| browser | `open-sse-line!` `close-sse-line!` `open-ws-line!` `send-message-on-ws-line!` `close-ws-line!` | sse and ws lines, reopened after a break until closed (sse: after `:reconnect-after-ms`, given, also when the server answered with an HTTP error; ws: after `:reopen-after-ms`, given); an sse line says when it opens (`:on-open`, `again?` after a break) and when it breaks (`:on-break`, once per break), the line's status for an offline banner |

Nothing has a default: every value that sets behaviour is written out,
the settings, every option, every key of a handler, a page and a name's
shapes (nil where nothing applies, `{}` for no reasons); a missing one refuses, named, with
every other problem at once. No function fills in an argument. What stays
fixed, and why: [the decision](decisions/2026-10-22-every-value-that-sets-behaviour-is-a-setting.md).
